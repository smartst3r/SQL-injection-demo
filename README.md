# SQL-injection-demo | Incomplete comments | Unpolished
This is a demo I made to show case SQL injections. It was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

This first part of the demo show how you can inject your own SQL to override a login

Using a search feature on this next demo site you can use SQL statements to query the layout of the database

You can then search the results to find tables of interest (in this case it's the user table)

Now searching within the user table you can query the user_name and user_password to get login details
